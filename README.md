# Tier Lane

## What is it?

A tier list website made for the Azur Lane community!

## Why did I make it?

I am in a gacha community and some people asked me to and I had time.

Now I do not have the time but I like this project because of the absurd amount of data it has (Why are there like 700+ characters???), I need to manage it wisely and that's a challenge I enjoy.

## Steps to update assets

In case you want to contribute or I develop [dementia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-po1PMtJJo&pp=ygUObWUgdnMgZGVtZW50aWE%3D).

1. Head over to the [assets repo](https://github.com/nirzon47/projects-assets/tree/main/azur-lane).
2. Install the dependencies from the root folder.
3. Copy new assets and move them to the `scrambled` folder, skip already existing assets.
4. Get the new assets, copy them to the `PNGs` folder. Hint: sort the files by modified.
5. Get the `groupInFolders.js` script from `utils` folder and drop it in `PNGs` folder.
6. Run the script you just copied.
7. Do a manual checkup for the operation you performed.
8. I am a bit confused right now since we didn't rename the CN names into EN names yet. It might be a manual step. Time to bring forth the //TODO: Good luck.
9. Yeah I will update the rest when I get more clarity. Been a while since I started the project. Also consider keeping CN names in JSON.

## Future Plans

-  Reformat JSON: Include CN name for better update cycle.
-  Automate the updating assets part, takes way too long.

## Why are so many commits unverified?

I switch device very often and sometimes I reset them too.

And I don't backup my GPG keys because I never think I would end up switching devices or resetting them.

## TODO (Personal tracker for steps)

1. Find a good drag and drop solution
